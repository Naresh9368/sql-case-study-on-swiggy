<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
<p><b>üåü Situation:</b><br>In this Swiggy Case Study, we found ourselves in the dynamic and competitive world of the food delivery industry. Swiggy, a leading player in the field, wanted to analyze its customer behavior and restaurant performance data to make data-driven decisions and gain a competitive edge.</p>

<p><b>üåü Task:</b><br>Our task was to explore the available data, extract meaningful insights, and address critical questions using SQL techniques. We had to utilize our SQL skills to query the database and extract valuable information to help Swiggy make informed decisions.</p>

<p><b>üåü Action:</b><br>We delved into the data and applied various SQL queries to answer essential questions and derive insights. We used SQL to filter, join, and aggregate data from different tables, enabling us to perform complex analyses and obtain results that would guide Swiggy's strategy.

<b>Some of the SQL techniques applied included:</b><br>
‚ûº Subqueries<br>
‚ûº JOIN operations<br>
‚ûº GROUP BY and HAVING clauses<br>
‚ûº Window functions (e.g., LAG function)<br>
‚ûº Common Table Expressions (CTE)<br>
Our actions led to the discovery of insights related to customer behavior, restaurant performance, favorite dishes, loyal customers, revenue growth, and more.</p>

<p><b>üåü Results:</b><br>Here are some of the key results and insights from our Swiggy Case Study:

1. We identified customers who had never placed an order, allowing Swiggy to focus on user engagement and retention strategies.<br>
2. Calculating the average price per dish helped Swiggy understand the pricing structure of different menu items.<br>
3. We pinpointed the restaurant with the highest number of orders for a specific month, assisting in resource allocation and promotion planning.<br>
4. Restaurants with monthly sales exceeding a certain threshold were identified, aiding in performance evaluation.<br>
5. By analyzing orders with order details for specific customers within a date range, Swiggy gained a detailed view of customer preferences.<br>
6. We determined each customer's favorite dish, providing insights into their ordering patterns.<br>
7. Recognizing the restaurant with the highest number of loyal, repeat customers helped build stronger customer relationships.<br>
8. Identifying the most loyal customers for each restaurant allowed for personalized marketing strategies.<br>
9. Month-over-month revenue growth was analyzed, offering insights into performance trends.<br>
10. Stay tuned for insights into product pairing recommendations, a fascinating aspect of the Swiggy experience.</p>
